## Prerequisites
1. Execute `git submodule init` first and then `git submodule update` to pull the _vsomeip_ project
2. Adjust all path specifications in every file containing `/home/mehmet/vscode-workspaces` according to your project path
3. Execute the `download-and-compile-nsd.bash` script and follow the instructions at the end to setup the authoritative name server

## Evaluation
Execute `python topo-1sw-Nhosts.py --help` to get a list with which the evaluation can be started with

There are eight evaluation options:
- A: vanilla (vsomeip as it is)
- B: w/ DNSSEC w/o SOME/IP SD
- C: w/ service authentication
- D: w/ service authentication + DNSSEC + DANE w/o SOME/IP SD
- E: w/ service and client authentiction
- F: w/ service and client authentiction + payload encryption
- G: w/ service and client authentication + DNSSEC + DANE
- H: w/ service and client authentication + DNSSEC + DANE + payload encryption

Moreover, an interactive mode is started for debugging purposes if the `--runs` option is omitted.

## Known Issues
- Wireshark is prone to freezing when evaluation options with authentication are used
- _vsomeip_ does not work properly when file or console logging is enabled but not redirected to the terminal or to a file, which is handled by the `topo-1sw-Nhosts.py` script (see STD_CONDITION variable)
